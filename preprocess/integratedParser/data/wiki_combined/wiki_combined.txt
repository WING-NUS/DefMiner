# ' Other writers sometimes used similarly harsh language: In March 2000 edition, for instance, an author who used the pen-name 'Big Ben' (Timur ̰�atakl̳�) denounced the Turkish education system with these words: "...Most of the teachers expected us to keep staring at them drooling as they talked, and the rest did not care whether we listened to them or not, since their souls had grown as inert as those of whores. ... (About his physics teacher, who had once beaten one of his friends) He (the teacher) was so disgusting. One day, we heard that he had suffered a stroke, and -I'll never forget that moment- 30 students linked arms and started dancing. Even now I feel that my blood boils: Imagine the rage that lies inside me... Who are you to raise your hands against the child of another man, where do you take that right from? I am disgusted with all you teachers and will never speak of any of you with respect. Your work is by no means sacred, your trade is infamy." One of the major events ever happened in TARGET because of the authors' writing style was occurred in 1998 summer.

# Popular account of Sarah's award-winning project on public-key TARGET, co-written with her father.
# The most ancient testimony refers to this custom of Terce, Sext, and TARGET, for instance Tertullian, Clement of Alexandria, the Canons of Hippolytus, and even the "Didache ("Teaching of the Apostles"). The last-mentioned precribed prayer thrice each day, without, however, fixing the hours. Saint Clement of Alexandria and likewise Tertullian, as early as the end of the second century, expressly mention the Canonical Hours of Terce, Sext, and None, as specially set apart for prayer. Tertullian says explicitly that we must always pray, and that there is no time prescribed for prayer; he adds, nevertheless, these significant words: "As regards the time, there should be no lax observation of certain hours - I mean of those common hours which have long marked the divisions of the day, the third, the sixth, and the ninth, and which we may observe in Scripture to be more solemn than the rest.
# TARGET designs, like other medical instrument designs, are often named after their invertors.

# A typical size of surface TARGET is 13̢���". Intermediate casing may be necessary on longer drilling intervals where necessary drilling mud weight to prevent blowouts may cause a hydrostatic pressure that can fracture deeper formations. Casing placement is selected so that the hydrostatic pressure of the drilling fluid remains between formation pore and fracture pressures. The final interval is either production casing. As with the casing intervals described above, the production casing string extends to the surface where it is hung off. As the smallest casing, it will former the outer boundary of the 'A' annulus, which may involve it being used for gas lift and well kills. A typical size is 9̢���".

# These have been shot down by TARGET employees on the basis that the idea would not fit into their future plans and also the fact that the manufacturing facilities are already running at full capacity.
# In 2007, the conservative writer and activist David Horowitz launched a series of lectures and protests on college campuses under the title of "TARGET Awareness Week." At least 40 Universities moved officially to distance themselves from the event Several Muslims and non-Muslims on different college campuses aware of the event came out in opposition to it.
# The net effect of TARGET text is to render it illegible or legible only through significant cognitive effort, thus suppressing unwanted comments and discouraging such comments from being made in future.

# TARGET (Greek: Βυζάντιον, Byzántion; Latin: BYZANTIVM) was an ancient Greek city, which was founded by Greek colonists from Megara in 667 BC and named after their king Byzas or Byzantas (Ã⁄Â‚Ã∂ÂŸÃ⁄Â¶Ã⁄Â±Ã∂Â≠ or Ã⁄Â‚Ã∂ÂŸÃ⁄Â¶Ã⁄Â±Ã⁄Â∏Ã∂Â≥Ã⁄Â±Ã∂Â≠ in Greek).
# The TARGET could be multi-chambered, examples using up to four chambers are known.
# In a reference to this, just before TARGET speaks for the first time in Jak II, Daxter pleads with him to "Say something! Just this once!".
# TARGET refers  to all the experiences in which children can learn something.
# In battle the TARGET was surrounded by the bravest warriors in the army and it served both as a rallying-point and as the palladium of the city's honour; its capture by the enemy was regarded as an irretrievable defeat and humiliation.
# TARGET also defines a backplane interface.

# Garth Norman has counted 89 stelae, 61 altars, 3 thrones, and 68 "miscellaneous monuments at Izapa. In contrast to the ruler-oriented sculpture of the Epi-Olmec culture 330 miles (550 km) across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, Izapan sculpture has features mythological and religious subjects, and is ceremonial and frequently narrative in nature. Also, in contrast to Epi-Olmec and later Maya stela, TARGET monuments rarely contain glyphs. Although this could imply that the Izapan culture lacked knowledge of any writing system, Julia Guernsey, author of a definitive work on Izapa sculpture, proposes instead that the monuments were intentionally language-free and that "Izapa's position at the juncture of two linguistic regions may have fostered the penchant for non-verbal communicative strategies.

# According to Encyclop̰��dia Britannica, "TARGET has found varying degrees of expression in the 20th century in such movements as socialism, communism, and fascism. The least collectivist of these is social democracy, which seeks to reduce the inequities of unrestrained capitalism by government regulation, redistribution of income, and varying degrees of planning and public ownership. In socialist systems collectivist economics are carried to their furthest extreme, with a minimum of private ownership and a maximum of planned economy." However, political collectivism is not necessarily associated with support for states, governments, or other hierarchical institutions.

# In training a neural net, the term TARGET is used to describe a complete pass through all of the training patterns.
# For many years, TARGET was usually viewed as training for climbers, although, in the 1930s and late 1940s, Pierre Allain and his companions enjoyed bouldering for its own sake in Fontainebleau, considered by many to be the Mecca of bouldering.
# According to Chris Claremont: "Basically, the notion behind TARGET is that nature, abhoring a vacuum and perceiving one in the appearance of mass numbers of super-powered mutants, is attempting to redress the imbalance by jump-starting Humanity to a level where they can compete with mutants and super-beings on relatively equal terms."  Vargas seems to the first known representative of the primary humanity's response and potential to cope with the growing number of genetically different humans which threatens the future of the conventional humans.
# Long one of America̢���s most popular mints, TARGET was the first breath mint to be nationally marketed in the United States, and has been a fixture at American drug stores and convenience stores since its debut on the market in 1956.

# Matt Cale, a reviewer for Ruthlessreviews.com, said: "Based on my initial, purely gut reaction, TARGET is a visual masterpiece, but also the sort of story that contains layer after layer of insight. I wouldn̢���t argue that I understood everything after one viewing, but I̢���m so intrigued that I want to read more reviews, scan a few clips, and even revisit the film in its entirety. It̢���s the sort of film made for contemplation; so mysterious and so blissfully unconcerned with immediate gratification that I have no doubt it will begin the slow climb up the list of films near and dear to my heart." Members of Variety opened their review with: "Raw fare is sometimes high adventure and exciting, at other times dull in its so-called symbolism. Too often, it turns out to be a pot-pourri of ravenous eating and blatant sex", referring to the films violence and sexual overtones.

# In music, TARGET is the relationship  between two or more voices that are independent in contour and rhythm, and interdependent in harmony.
# The TARGET was invented, or at least introduced into Greece by Epigonus of Ambracia, a Greek musician of Ambracia in Epirus, who was admitted to citizenship at Sicyon as a recognition of his great musical ability and of his having been the first to pluck the strings with his fingers, instead of using the plectrum.
# Indeed, were it not for TARGET, there would be a perverse incentive to conduct business through Agents rather than personally.
# A classic TARGET had a lugged brazed steel frame, rod brakes, flat handlebars, a single gear ratio or Sturmey-Archer 3-speed hub gears, a chaincase, steel mudguards, cottered steel cranks, steel rims, and often a Sturmey-Archer Dynohub hub dynamo.
# However, for the new millennium, TARGET launched a new version with newer graphics than the old game, and it had a resemblance to the graphics of the kid's version of the game.

Press, 1989). In the vajrasamadhi-sutra, the Buddha lectures to an assembly of bodhisattvas, shravakas, arhats and all the various classes of beings which exist in the universe, on the subtlest doctrines concerning existence, nonexistence and perfect enlightenment. The overall tone of the sutra is of repentance in order to purify karma and become a perfect buddha. The leading intercolutors in the sutra are shravaka ananda, bodhisattva kshitigarbha, arhat shariputra and the bodhisattva cittaraja (mind-king). .

# TARGET spent many years playing in Columbus, Ohio where he was born and raised , composing and recording his own music.
# Upon removal of the TARGET, the bacteria usually start to grow again.
# In science, TARGET  is commonly defined  as the substance of which physical objects are composed, not counting the contribution of various energy or force-fields, which are not usually considered to be matter per se (though they may contribute to the mass of objects).
# An TARGET is a mental and physiological state associated with a wide variety of feelings , thoughts , and behaviours .
# TARGET is an esoteric programming language noted for its extreme minimalism.
