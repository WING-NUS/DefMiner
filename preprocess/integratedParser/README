Run instruction 
1. Add execution right to the external jars chmod + x lib/* 
2. run the main program.
It takes one argument which is the input file 

	java -Xmx4g -cp bin:lib/* main.IntegratedParser test.txt 

The program will create a folder with the same name and contains 
all the outcome of all the preprocessing. In all the files , 
we output one sentence per line .

test/ 
|-- test.word orignial 		word 
|-- test.pos 			pos tags for each word 
|-- test.ne			named entity tag for each word
|-- test.dep 			dependencies for each sentence , 
				one dependency per line . Sentences 
				are separated by empty line 
|-- test.chunk 			the shallow parsing tag for each word 
|-- test.seq 			the collapsed shallow parsing sequence 
				for each sentence .
|-- test.parent			the parent in the dependency relation
				one line per sentence, each token is
				the parent of a word
|-- test.parpos			the pos tag of the parent word
|-- test.tag			the golden standard tag (token level,
				*for learning model only)
